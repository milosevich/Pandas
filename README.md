My pandas and matplotlib exercises in jupyter notebook.
Pandas is a fundamental tool to learn in the field of Data Science.

How to getting started:
- open command prompt in windows (type cmd)
- type cd Desktop\py\ (if you don't have py folder, make it with 'mkdir py')
- py -3.7 -m venv pandas_venv # create virtual environment with name 'pandas_venv'
- pandas_venv\Scripts\activate # activate virtual environment
- pip install pandas # install pandas
- pip install jupyterlab # install jupyter notebook for work
# data for analisys  on website insights.stackoverflow.com/survey then 2019.csv
# put folder on Desktop/py/Pandas-Demo 
- jupyter notebook # then from cmd type

A few real world example are:

- Stack_overflow_developer_survey_results
